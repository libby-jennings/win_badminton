					<h2>More quality practice, more fun, more purpose, more medals...</h2>
					<p>
						At Win Badminton we offer world class coaching in an enjoyable environment for players with
						a clear desire to learn and progress in performance badminton. We work with clubs and
						counties to offer those with the most commitment and ambition, additional training
						opportunities on a pathway where they can take the necessary steps to reach their
						potential. Our aim is to develop well-rounded, highly-skilled young players with the
						creativity, confidence and critical thinking skills needed for a successful life in
						sport.
					</p>
					<h2>Extraordinary achievement requires extraordinary preparation...</h2>
					<p>
						Research has revealed it takes approximately 10,000 hours of deep, purposeful practice to
						become an expert performer in any field. Our structured performance programme offers a
						minimum of two squad sessions each week and access to an online profiling system where
						players work with coaches to plan, track and evaluate their progress in training and
						competition. Our progressive performance pathway (see model) allows players to gradually
						increase the frequency, intensity and purpose of their training in order to achieve
						their long-term goals in sporting excellence.
					</p>
					<h2>Our secret is in the planning...</h2>
					<p>
						Our coaching team meets regularly to plan the relevant coaching themes for each squad,
						themes guided by principles of long-term player development and the latest trends in
						international junior badminton. Sessions are planned in advance and delivered using a
						wide range of training methods and teaching strategies that combine individualised
						learning and teamwork to optimise learning, productivity and enjoyment. We don’t just
						drill them; we recognise that every player learns differently with their own preferences
						and needs and appreciate that all players will learn and grow at different rates.
					</p>
					<h2>The only sustainable competitive advantage you have is the ability to learn faster
					and better than your opposition...</h2>
					<p>
						We embed a ‘learning and performance’ culture where the players think for
						themselves about the quality and purpose of their training and always value
						opportunities to learn. Players practice to perform so that they can think
						clearly under-pressure, control nerves and gain that edge when it counts.
						The mental toughness required to win in the heat of competition is something that
						can be learned and improved. We therefore make sure we assist at key tournaments to
						help players develop a winning mentality as well as a professional and healthy
						approach to their competition.
					</p>
					<h2>Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t you’re probably right...</h2>
					<p>
						Our Win Badminton Academy sessions offer players the opportunity to supplement their
						squad sessions with training in the day-time alongside full-time players who are based
						at Bisham Abbey studying and boarding with the Win Tennis Academy (see Academy Education
						Handbook). Our coaching team is supported by a Sport Science team at Bisham Abbey who
						provide the strength and conditioning education and support necessary for our players
						to reach high levels of physical performance as well as support in areas such as sports
						nutrition, psychology and performance lifestyle management.
