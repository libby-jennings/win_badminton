						<h2>More quality practice, more fun, more purpose, more medals...</h2>
					<p>
						At Win Badminton we offer world class coaching in an enjoyable environment for players with a desire to learn and progress in performance badminton. We work with clubs and counties to offer those with the most commitment and ambition additional training opportunities on a pathway to reach their potential. Our aim is to develop well-rounded, highly-skilled young players with the creativity, confidence and critical thinking skills needed for a successful life in sport.
					</p>
					<h2>Extraordinary achievement requires extraordinary preparation...</h2>
					<p>
						Research has revealed it takes approximately 10,000 hours of deep, purposeful practice to become an expert performer in any field. Our structured performance programme offers a minimum of two squad sessions each week and our performance pathway (see model) allows players to gradually increase the frequency, intensity and purpose of their training in order to achieve their long-term goals in sporting excellence.
					</p>
					<h2>Our secret is in the planning...</h2>
					<p>
						Our coaching team meets regularly to plan the coaching themes for each squad, guided by principles of long-term player development and the latest trends in international junior badminton. Sessions are planned in advance and delivered using a range of training methods that combine individualised learning and teamwork. We don’t just drill them; we recognise that every player learns differently with their own preferences and needs and appreciate that all players will learn and grow at different rates.
					</p>
					<h2>The only sustainable competitive advantage you have is the ability to learn faster and better than your opposition...</h2>
					<p>
						We embed a ‘learning and performance’ culture, where the players think for themselves about the quality and purpose of their training. Players practice to perform so that they can think clearly under-pressure, control nerves and gain that edge when it counts. The mental toughness required to win in the heat of competition is something that can be learned and improved. We assist at key tournaments to help players develop a winning mentality as well as a professional and healthy approach to their competition.
					</p>
					<h2>Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t you’re probably right...</h2>
					<p>
						Our Win Badminton Academy sessions offer players the opportunity to supplement their squad sessions with training in the day-time. Our coaching team is supported by a Sport Science team at Bisham Abbey who provide the strength and conditioning education and support necessary for our players to reach high levels of physical performance as well as support in areas such as sports nutrition, psychology and performance lifestyle management.
